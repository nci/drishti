# Drishti

Drishti is an open-source scientific visualisation software designed by Ajay Limaye at the National Computational Infrastructure's VizLab.

The central idea of Drishti is that scientists can use it to explore and present volumetric datasets without extensive training.

Drishti has been developed with its end use in mind: ie. visualising volumetric data, such as tomography data, electron-microscopy data, etc.

Drishti works on GPUs with atleast OpenGL 3.3 capability.

Drishti stands for vision or insight in Sanskrit, an Indian language.

## Minimum graphics hardware configuration
  The single most important determinant of Drishti performance for visualization is the graphics card.  A dedicated graphics card with atleast 2GB memory is recommended as a minimum (more the merrier).  Drishti would work on graphics cards with smaller memory, the volume sizes will be much more limited in these cases.
